## Overview

The list's structure is defined by the contents of the `tokens` folder. There,
you can see one file for each chain the Carrot protocol supports and for which
the token list want to keep track of tokens.

This kind of file structure is there for clarity only, since there's a build
command the role of which is to squash them all together at build time,
generating the `tokens` section of the token list. Metadata about the list (such
as the name, the logo, the timestamp etc) is hardcoded/generated in the build
script, while the version is taken directly from the `package.json` file.

## Adding tokens

In order to add a token to the list, update its token files under `./tokens`
depending on the chain the token you want to add is deployed on (if you want to
add a gnosis token for example look for the `gnosis.json` file).

## Generating the list locally

Once all the updates you want have been applied, the list can be generated by
running the `build` command.

You will find the generated list under the `out` folder.
